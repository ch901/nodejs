1. A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. The word “monolith” is often attributed to something large and glacial, which isn't far from the truth of a monolith architecture for software design.

2. Microservices are an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services (i.e. loosely coupled modules/components). Each module supports a specific business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of services.

Instead of sharing a single database as in Monolithic application, each microservice has its own database. Having a database per service is essential if you want to benefit from microservices, because it ensures loose coupling. Each of the services has its own database. Moreover, a service can use a type of database that is best suited to its needs.

Consider the same example of the e-commerce application, which consists of several components/modules. Define each component/module as a separate loosely coupled service depending on the requirement, which may collaborate with each other based on the scenario. We can have following services for a complete application

3. microservices appeals to me more. the monolithic archetecture, is less expensive and needs less work force to manage and that is good for business as its cost effective. however, its bulky and complex. if anything goes wrong the entire system collapses. and all other parts could be affected.

microservices on the other hand, breaks it applications into smaller chunks making room for specialization and effeciency, handlers of the operations are therefore focused and effective. a problem in one specialty may not affect the other, thereby loses are minimal.

4. No node js is generally single threaded and yes node.js in itself is multithreaded because it can support other operation and work concurrently

5. REPL means Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
